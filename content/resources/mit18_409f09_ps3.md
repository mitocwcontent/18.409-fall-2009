description: Problem set on iterative methods for linear algebra, computing eigenvalues
  with the power method, speeding up eigenvalue computation and the Lanczos method,
  reducing diagonally dominant linear systems to Laplacians, building augmented spanning
  tree preconditioners, Chebyshev polynomials, lattices, small solutions to modular
  polynomial equations and attacking, and low-exponent RSA encryption.
